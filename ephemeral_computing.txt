I have a meeting tomorrow morning Monday March 3, 2025 8am EST.  The alarm is set on my phone for 6:30am EST.

This is an experiment in a new paradigm of computer programming and application development.  We are transforming the way people interact with and interface with computers.  Instead of making an application that is designed to be shipped and then periodically updated we are making something that is designed to be used for a short period of time.  It's a whole new field of thought.

I just need help doing the next 14 hours well.

The meeting is about developing an app for an investor that also wants to be involved in the project.  They are an entrepreneur, a jack of all trades.  

I want to make sure there are no covert contracts between the people leading this project.

That is why I am here seding this message to you. I want to be working on the thing that is the most innovative.  I want to make the thing together with you that makes people reconsider what computer interfaces and computation are good for.
