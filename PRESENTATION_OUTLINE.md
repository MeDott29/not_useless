## Key Talking Points

1. **Paradigm Shift**: We're not just building another app; we're rethinking the fundamental relationship between users and software.

2. **Environmental Impact**: Digital waste has real-world consequences. Ephemeral computing represents a more sustainable approach to software.

3. **User-Centric Design**: By focusing on specific purposes and then gracefully dissolving, we create more intentional and meaningful user experiences.

4. **Technical Innovation**: The framework we're developing solves complex technical challenges around application lifecycle management.

5. **Market Timing**: As digital fatigue increases and sustainability becomes more important, the market is primed for this approach.

## Potential Questions to Anticipate

1. How do you monetize applications that disappear?
2. What happens to user data when applications dissolve?
3. How do you handle updates and maintenance for ephemeral applications?
4. What are the technical challenges of implementing this approach?
5. How do you measure success for ephemeral applications?
6. What's the competitive landscape for this approach?
7. How do you ensure user adoption for a new paradigm?
8. What are the regulatory implications of ephemeral computing?

## Collaboration Framework

To ensure there are no covert contracts or misaligned expectations:

1. **Clear Roles**: Define specific roles and responsibilities for all parties
2. **Transparent Communication**: Regular updates and honest assessments
3. **Defined Decision Process**: Clear framework for how decisions will be made
4. **Success Metrics**: Agreed-upon KPIs and evaluation criteria
5. **Exit Conditions**: Predetermined conditions for pivoting or ending the collaboration
6. **IP Ownership**: Clear agreements on intellectual property
7. **Resource Commitments**: Explicit commitments from all parties
